What it is
==========
The Minnesota Metadata Editor (MME) is a desktop application that is intended to simplify and expedite the process of developing geospatial metadata.  

The program operates as a standalone application that edits metadata XML files.

The MME allows users to create, edit and display metadata that adheres to the [Minnesota Geographic Metadata Guildelines (MGMG version 1.2)](http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/mgmg/metadata.htm), an implementation of the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC's) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM).  

The MME is a customized version of the EPA Metadata Editor (EME) 3.1.1.  For more information on the EPA Metadata Editor, see [https://edg.epa.gov/EME/](https://edg.epa.gov/EME/).
